A few years ago I came across a passage in a book (for the life of me I can't remember the title) that told a story of a man in a market with a sign that read "Fresh Fish Sold Here." What ensues is a good lesson for technical writers and for writers in general.

## Writing Concise

Let's deconstruct the sign. If we start with *Fresh* it is easy to see why the word is unnecesary. The man in the market wouldn't be selling fish that isn't fresh, would he? 

Removing *Fresh* leaves us with "Fish Sold Here." I think you can see where this is going. If we use the same objective reasoning that focuses on a word beeing essential, then the words *Sold* and *Here* as can be removed as well. *Sold* is unnecesary since the man is behind a stand in a market, and *Here* is unnecesarry, because, where else would the man be selling fish?

In the end, we are left only with the word "Fish." 

This is a simple example of deconstructing a sentence, but it is paramount to being a successful technical writer. Each sentence should come under this level of scrutiny to better serve the readers.

## Why Concision is Needed

As technical writers it is our job to [reduce the cognitive load](https://uxplanet.org/8-ways-to-reduce-cognitive-load-part-1-cc2048d1b157) of our readers. With a growing number of documents being published, it can be daunting parsing through information. If we make our sentences concise, we produce better information.
