## Avoiding sexist language

Avoiding sexist language is something that has received a lot of attention over the past few years and for good reason. There are parts of speech and phrases that have crept into everyday speaking and writing patterns, but to create inclusive content, sexist language should be avoided.

In general we should avoid:

* Using pronouns that exclusively refer to a gender, when the information is genderless.
* Using gender driven words or phrases.

## Avoiding conflict

When reviewing a product or feature it is common to see products described in a way that puts down their competition. That is not a good practice. When documenting a feature or project, try to be objective. Doing so helps to promote sound business practices and helps show that you do not need to harm other companies or their products for yours to stand out.
