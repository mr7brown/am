## Considering your audience

Understanding your audience and the medium in which you are writing is essential for writing in the appropriate tone. In general, your writing should be in a tone that is conversational and professional. Again, remember that the purpose is for the information to be understood.

It is easy to be stiff when writing and write in ways that you would never speak. To avoid this try thinking about the point you're attempting to make. Then try to think of how you would explain your point to a friend or colleague, while keeping in mind that the content still needs to be professional.

## General tips

When writing, you should keep the words accessibility and fairness in mind. To ensure that the documentation is both accessible and fair, you should avoid:

* Using jargon or wording that may confuse readers
* Writing long, complicated sentences
* Having a structure that is too parallel (starting each sentence or section the same way)
* Making pop culture references
* Sexism, ableism, or anthropomorphic language
* Overusing "please"
