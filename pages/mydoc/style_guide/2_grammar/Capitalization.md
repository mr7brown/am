## Capitalizing headings

* In document titles and page headings, use sentence case. That said, you should still capitalize all proper nouns; for more information on capitalization rules, see [Help with Capitals](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/mechanics/help_with_capitals.html).
* Do not put a period at the end of a heading.
* Avoid using acronyms in headings, unless you are sure that the term is widely known (NASA, FAQ).

## Lists

Both `ol` and `ul` lists should be in sentence case.

## Tables

Tables should be in sentence case.

## Text following a colon

Text following a colon (:) should always be proceeded with a capitalized letter.
