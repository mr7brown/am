## Example

The example below is an overly verbose sentence that is strictly for illustrating the differences in America and British spelling.
<br><br>
<i class="fa fa-thumbs-down fa-lg" style="color: red;"></i> **Not recommended:** Organising your folders by colour can help provide visual cues for data structures. It can also help you to manoeuvre through your desktop more efficiently. <br><br>
<i class="fa fa-thumbs-up fa-lg" style="color: green;"></i> **Recommended:** Organizing your folders by color can help provide visual cues for data structures. It can also help you to maneuver through your desktop more efficiently. 

## Closing thoughts

While it is necessary to default to American spelling, that does not mean that you should not look for ways to rewrite a sentence, or reword a piece of information. If there is a chance for confusion, try to avoid the word. 

For example:

* Instead of analyze, use examine.
* Instead of authorize, use approve.
* Instead of organize, use structure.

Also note that it may not be possible to change the word or phrasing in all situations and that's okay.
