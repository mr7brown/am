This style guide provides general technical editing guidelines for anyone engaged in technical writing. The guide is kept at a pretty high-level so that it is able to be used across industries. That said, the contents of the guide are written primarily for a technical audience.

## Objective

The primary goal of this guide is to provide a consistent approach for documentation. In general, this guide is meant to make the decision-making process for editing technical/non-technical documentation easier.

A secondary goal of this style guide is to provide information that can help improve the overall quality of documentation. When documenting anything it is important to understand that it will be read by someone and while the reader may change, the information and the understanding should not. This guide, along with sound writing practices should help you to achieve that goal.

## Non-goals

The information in this guideline is not meant to be a replacement for some of the traditional style-guides that have more detail on grammar, punctuation, and general writing (the resources section has more information on some well respected style guides). Instead, this guideline contains supplementary information geared towards the editorial side of technical documentation.

## Using the guide

This guideline is broken down by key topics that offer you the flexibility to jump around to an area of interest or to a specific area that you may have a question on.

As a general note and maybe the most important aspect of this guide: you should treat this as a guideline and not as set of hard rules. There may be situations where the guidelines need to be overruled or where personal preference or a company rule may be more fitting for the documentation; and that is okay.

## Closing notes

While this guide focuses on industry standards and how to document information in a professional setting, much of the information can also be used as a general guide to writing.
