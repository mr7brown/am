## Overview

This page shows a collection of images and examples from the knowledge base
I developed using a combination of Wiki syntax and HTML. Also, to stay compliant
with the NDA signed with Facebook, company sensitive information has been
redacted and replaced with the infamous <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> placeholder text.

Both landing pages haven proven successful. For example, the original goal was
to create a documentation and standards portal for internal reference; while
this goal succeeded, Enterprise Engineering as a whole has begun to adopt this
template for documentation management and information architecture.

## Example knowledge base

The images below are examples from the knowledge base that was created for
the Enterprise Engineering New Builds (EENB) team.

### Example standards landing page

The landing page below was developed using both Wiki syntax and HTML.

 {% include image.html file="kb.png" alt="Example" %}

To maintain global design standards and ensure the correct placement of AV/VC
equipment, the team references this landing page.

### Example documentation landing page

Below is an example of the documentation portal.

{% include image.html file="documentation.png" alt="Example" %}

Similar to the landing page for standards, the documentation landing page is the
first place that team members go to when looking for guides and processes.
Currently the landing page alone is generating just over 3,000 hits per week.
