## Overview

The Portfolio Program Managers (PPMs) for the NORCAL and LATAM regions have
developed a new, streamlined process for passing down projects to Deployment
Project Managers (DPMs). PPMs will now complete a template and assign projects
through the Project Tool - after performing analysis of the DPMs existing
workload.

This process outlines how to access the template, as well as how the template
should be filled out.

{% include important.html content="Project information should not be loaded into Project Tool until the project is live. Reason being: all project information
should be treated as classified until it is able to be publicly shared." %}

## Getting started with the template

Use the [REDACTED] project for a template.

Once the template is open, press the <i>C</i> key to copy the project. (Use ABC
Tool as a reference for the remaining sections.)

## Project Tool sections

The template contains five primary sections in the description field, as well
as the External Resources field.

### Project overview

The project overview differs from project to project, but at a high-level it
should contain:

* Project location & size
* Headcount
* Room count
* Which team the build is for

### Constraints - assumptions - risks - dependencies

Here PPMs should enter any known constraints, assumptions, risks, or dependencies.
One piece of information that should be placed into this section is the
anticipated FDOB date.

### High-level tasks and responsibilities

Enter the scope that DPMs should be following throughout the projectâ€™s
lifecycle. For example, DPMs should be monitoring and maintaining:

* Design PO
* ABC updates
* EENB design
* EENB procurement
* Construction schedule coordination
* Deployment Schedule development and coordination
* Vendor Communication
* Current Status Reports
* Current Issue Reports

and they should also understand that any complications within the outlined scope
should be fully communicated with the PPM for the project.

### Resources

Here PPMs should put links to relevant templates, standards, and any other
useful resources that DPMs or Project Coordinators (PCs) may need to reference.
For example, DPMs may need to reference:

* EENB timeline
* DPM checklist
* EENB standards
* Facilities project folder (this location will vary from project to project, so
be sure to grab the link for the project that is being passed down)
* Project weekly meeting ID - if available

### Key project team

In the key project team section, PPMs should list the contact information for
ALL XFNs for the project. For example, DPMs and PCs will need to know the
contact information for:

* Architect
* General Contractors (GCs)

### External resources

The external resources section (on the right-hand side of the screen) is where
PPMs should attach relevant documents. PPMs may want to attach:

* Preliminary project schedule
* Project budget
* Test fits
* Spots & dots (as applicable)

## Assigning project

After completing the template and performing a load assessment for DPMs, use the
Roles section to add project members (both EENB and Facilities).

## Project Snapshot

To assist with understanding project deviances, PPMs need to take a snapshot of
the project page to record the information that is being handed off.

## Pass down meeting

As a best practice, PPMs should schedule a pass down meeting with DPMs to ensure
that the DPM is fully aware of the project scope. Additionally, this meeting
should allow the PPMs to ask any questions regarding project execution
expectations.
